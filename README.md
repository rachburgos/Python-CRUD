Summary: This program manages a database for anime. You can add new entries into the database, as well as delete, 
         display and update them through a GUI. Inputs are taken from entryboxes, optionmenu, and radiobutton. 
         Records are shown through the Treeview widget. Colunns in the Treeview are: Anime ID, Anime Name, Genre, 
         Episodes, Airing Season, and First Season?
Additional requirements: Treeview must display db on opening even if it makes the display button redundant, making 
                         changes to the db must be reflected immediately, buttons must have the same length, no 
                         messageboxes for verification (probably too annoying).
Optional features (not implemented): Search bar for db, picture / icon displayed inside GUI, preventing duplicate IDs.
