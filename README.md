## Summary
This program manages a database for anime. You can add, delete, display and update entries through a GUI. Inputs are taken from entryboxes, optionmenu, and radiobutton. Records are shown through the Treeview widget. Columns in the Treeview are: Anime ID, Anime Name, Genre, Episodes, Airing Season, and First Season.
## Additional details
- Treeview must display db on execution even if it makes the display button redundant
- Making changes to the db must be reflected immediately
- Buttons must have the same length
- No messageboxes for verification (probably too annoying)
## Optional features (not implemented)
- Search bar
- Picture / icon displayed inside GUI
- Preventing duplicate IDs
